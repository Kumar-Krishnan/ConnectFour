# Connect Four

* Deployed on Netlify: http://vibrant-rosalind-8cefd3.netlify.com/
* Work Flow: https://trello.com/b/jzYJsZFf/connectfour
* Portfolio: https://kumar-krishnan.github.io/

## The challenges of the project
  - Creating a 2 dimensional array to represent the visual grid that players interact with.
  - Making that array responsive to the actions of the player on the screen
  - Working with a top down array while the visual grid is bottom up.
  - Checking the game for when the player has made a winning move.
  - Determining which player should be declared winner at time of winning.
  - Accounting for outlier cases such as filling all grids without a clear winner. 
  - Checking values across a two dimensional array in a diagonal manner.
  
  
 The theme of this project borrows from the Tron Series.
